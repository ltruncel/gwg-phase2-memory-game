This is a project I completed during phase 2 of the Grow With Google Scholarship program through Udacity.  Click index.html to play the game.  

Following is the original Readme from Udacity with instructions to complete the project.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
